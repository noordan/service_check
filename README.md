# service_check
Simple python script that will e-mail you if your service goes down.

You can call this script with "python3 service_check.py {service_name}" from a regular status check.
To use service_check you only have to add a sender address, reciver address and a smtp server.

I use it with a motd that check system information like service status and write it out when you enter your system.
